# BankDatabase
This code implements a bank database- storing the names, details and bank information of 10,000 customers. 
This is done using:

      (A) a linked list, and 
      (B) a binary search tree

The user is then given the opportunity to run the program, which:

      - provides them with information on the total bank balance
      - gives the user the ability to search for a customer in the bank through their Customer ID number 
      
The aim of this exercise is to:

      - demonstrate both implementation methods, and 
      - to determine which method is most efficient when it comes to traversing both the linked list and the binary search tree.
